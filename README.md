## Instructions

Open the index.html to open the site. There is a side menu to the left of the page. You choose between the feeds(urls and names) by clicking on them.

### What did i do ?

 I have downloaded the project from the github link provided by the **Udacity**. I have throughly read the readme.md file provided by them and the comments in the feedreader.js

### Jasmine 
 Using Jasmine I have created the suites and specs using the **describe and it** function.

### Jquery
 For checking the menu is hidden when the page loads I have checked the class attribute of the body class using the attr function provided by the Jquery.

### Asynchronous methods
 I have used the jasmine done function to test asynchronous functions by sending it as a callback.

### Conclusion
 I really enjoyed making the suites and specs for the website.I learned new things about testing with this project.
